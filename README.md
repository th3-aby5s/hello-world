# hello-world
- This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
+ My name is Aine Tuazon, but I prefer to be called Azure. I'm 18 years old. My house is in the northwest section of Carlow, beside Laois, and I am not married. I'm a student at SETU Waterford, and I get home everyday by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a cup of tea and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a Computer Science major who wishes to live a very quiet chronically online-styled life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to game I wouldn't lose to anyone.
